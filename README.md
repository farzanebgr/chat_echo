# chat_echo
Created by Django Channels
   First, we start the application with -python manager.py startapp echo_app
   "name_type" helps us know what the name is when the project gets bigger and bigger
    echo_app should be in chat_echo and in settings.py file in INSTALLED_APPS. so that the program is known throughout the project.
